# Skypager Devpack

Provides a webpack based hot reloadable dev server and compile tool for use with any skypager project. 

Can be used to serve a web or desktop application, or as a build tool to render a project and publish it as a website to the skypager.io platform.

## Installation

The `skypager-devpack` package is automatically installed as part of the `skypager-presets` package.  This makes the CLI available anywhere within the project structure.
