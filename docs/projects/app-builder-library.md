# App Builder Library

The `App Builder Library` Application is a `Skypager Authoring Experience` that is more finely tailored toward 
the management of a software application portfolio consisting of web and mobile applications that should be published to the app store or internet.  

There are many kinds of businesses, communities, and smaller social networks, leagues, and organizations, which could benefit from having their own private mobile application experience as a way to streamline common interactions and stay connected.  We like to categorize these applications, the features they contain, and the integrations they often rely on by the `Vertical` category.

Instances of the App Builder Library can be white labeled and generated for different `Resellers` or `Vertical Partners` who have strong relationships with large networks of `Application Customers` who want to publish an application for their business or community.
