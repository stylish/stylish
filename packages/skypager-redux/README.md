# Skypager Redux

A Skypager Project is easily snapshotable in a form which lends itself to powering react applications especially through the use of the Flux architecture in general, and the `redux` ecosystem in particular.

Skypager will generate predictable enough state from the contents of any filesystem folder -- especially from the same `Git SHA`. Redux has a few things conceptually in common with a log of git commits.  The state representation is also immutable in a sense that the only way to change it permanently is through changing the content of the project.
