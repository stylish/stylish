# Skypager Portfolio Plugin

Develop a portfolio of skypager projects.  The parent project for skypager itself depends on this plugin.

## Features

- A portfolio is the parent, or root project. A portolio represents a larger effort that is divided into separate projects.  
- A portfolio references many different skypager projects and the components they contain. 
- A portfolio treats its projects as entities that can be queried and treated as data. 

## Use Cases

- Keep dependencies and configuration up to date and consistent across projects
- Develop summary views of many projects at once.
- Create a summary page for a project, with highlights and links to more specifics.
- Run similar tasks and scripts for each project (e.g. `npm publish`, `npm run test`, `git pull origin master`)
- Maintain a consistency of ideas, tooling, dependencies, and processes across many projects at once
- Perform bulk / programmatic manipulation of project source code files
