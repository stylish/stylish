# Document Viewer

The Document Viewer component will take any `Skypager.Document` and render it for viewing purposes.  Since each `Skypager.Document` may require additional UI helpers, components, or assets to display as intended, the DocumentViewer will manage making sure these components and assets are avaialble to the document.
