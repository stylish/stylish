# Geolocation

Geolocation allows a business to provide features based on 
`User Location Awareness` and `Proximity` such as geofences which trigger alerts when a user within a certain radius, or checkins or other ways of ensuring a user is at a particular place in order to use a feature.

## Requirements

Depending on the application there are different requirements.  Regardless, for Privacy reasons, Geolocation features are only possible when a user enables them.
