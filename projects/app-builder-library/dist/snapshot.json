You're looking at the docs for an Official Bootstrap Theme—thanks for your purchase! This theme has been lovingly crafted by Bootstrap's founders and friends to help you build awesome projects on the web. Let's dive in.\n\nEach theme is designed as it's own toolkit—a series of well designed, intuitive, and cohesive components—built on top of Bootstrap. If you've used Bootstrap itself, you'll find this all super familiar, but with new aesthetics, new components, beautiful and extensive examples, and easy-to-use build tools and documentation.\n\nSince this theme is based on Bootstrap, and includes nearly everything Bootstrap itself does, you'll want to give the [official project documentation](http://getbootstrap.com) a once over before continuing. There's also [the kitchen sink]({{ relative }}bootstrap/index.html)—a one-page view of all Bootstrap's components restyled by this theme.\n\nFor everything else, including compiling and using this Bootstrap theme, read through the docs below.\n\nThanks, and enjoy!\n\n# What's included\n\nWithin your Bootstrap theme you'll find the following directories and files, grouping common resources and providing both compiled and minified distribution files, as well as raw source files.\n\n{% highlight bash %}\ntheme/\n  ├── gulpfile.js\n  ├── package.json\n  ├── README.md\n  ├── docs/\n  ├── less/\n  │   ├── bootstrap/\n  │   ├── custom/\n  │   ├── variables.less\n  │   └── toolkit.less\n  ├── js/\n  │   ├── bootstrap/\n  │   └── custom/\n  ├── fonts/\n  │   ├── bootstrap-entypo.eot\n  │   ├── bootstrap-entypo.svg\n  │   ├── bootstrap-entypo.ttf\n  │   ├── bootstrap-entypo.woff\n  │   └── bootstrap-entypo.woff2\n  └── dist/\n      ├── toolkit.css\n      ├── toolkit.css.map\n      ├── toolkit.min.css\n      ├── toolkit.min.css.map\n      ├── toolkit.js\n      └── toolkit.min.js\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo view your Bootstrap Theme documentation, simply find the docs directory and open index.html in your favorite browser.\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n$ open docs/index.html\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n## Gulpfile.js\n\nIf you're after more customization we've also included a custom [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) file, which can be used to quickly re-compile a theme's CSS and JS. You'll need to install both [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and Gulp before using our included `gulpfile.js`.\n\nOnce node is installed, run the following npm command to install Gulp.\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n$ npm install gulp -g\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nWhen you're done, make sure you've installed the rest of the theme's dependencies:\n\n{% highlight bash %}\n$ npm install\n{% endhighlight %}\n\nNow, modify your source files and run `gulp` to generate new local `dist/` files automatically. **Be aware that this replaces existing `dist/` files**, so proceed with caution.\n\n## Theme source code\n\nThe `less/`, `js/`, and `fonts/` directories contain the source code for our CSS, JS, and icon fonts (respectively). Within the `less/` and `js/` directories you'll find two subdirectories:\n\n- `bootstrap/`, which contains the most recently released version of Bootstrap (v3.3.5).\n- `custom/`, which contains all of the custom components and overrides authored specifically for this theme.\n\nThe `dist/` folder includes everything above, built into single CSS and JS files that can easily be integrated into your project.\n\nThe `docs/` folder includes the source code for our documentation, as well as a handful of live examples.\n\nThe remaining files not specifically mentioned above provide support for packages, license information, and development.\n\n\n# Custom builds\n\nLeverage the included source files and `gulpfile.js` to customize your Bootstrap Theme for your exact needs. Change variables, exclude components, and more.\n\n- `toolkit.less` is the entry point for Less files - to build your own custom build, simply modify your local custom files or edit the includes listed here. Note: some themes also rely on a shared `components.less` file, which you can find imported in your `toolkit.less`.\n- `variables.less` is home to your theme's variables. Note that your theme's `variables` file depends on and overrides an existing Bootstrap variable file (found in /less/bootstrap/variables.less).\n\n\n# Basic template\n\nThe basic template is a guideline for how to structure your pages when building with a Bootstrap Theme. Included below are all the necessary bits for using the theme's CSS and JS, as well as some friendly reminders.\n\nCopy the example below into a new HTML file to get started with it.\n\n{% highlight html %}\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <!-- These meta tags come first. -->\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n\n    <title>Bootstrap Theme Example</title>\n\n    <!-- Include the CSS -->\n    <link href=\"dist/toolkit.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n\n    <!-- Include jQuery (required) and the JS -->\n    <script src=\"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"dist/toolkit.min.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n# Utilities\n\nUtilities, or utility classes, are a series of single-purpose, immutable classes designed to reduce duplication in your compiled CSS.

It’s especially good at measuring traffic sources and ad campaigns.\n\n[Product Website](http://google.com/analytics)\n\n## Basic Options\n\n- *Website Tracking ID*: Your website's Tracking ID is in the **Tracking Info** tab on the [Admin Page](https://www.google.com/analytics/web/#management/Property) of Google Analytics. Leave it blank if you don't have a website property.\n- *Use Classic Analytics on Your Site*: **Important:** When creating your Google Analytics profile, you can choose between **Classic** and **Universal** Analytics. After March 2013, new profiles default to Universal, while earlier ones are Classic. An easy test: if you see `_gaq.push` in your code you're using Classic, so enable this.\n- *Remarketing, Display Ads and Demographic Reports.*: This works with both Universal and Classic tracking methods.\n- *Mobile Tracking ID*: Google Analytics tracks mobile apps separately, so you'll want to create a separate Google Analytics mobile app property. Leave it blank if you don't have a mobile app property.\n- *Serverside Tracking ID*: Your Serverside Tracking ID is the UA code for the Google Analytics property you want to send server-side calls to. Leave it blank if you don't have a server-side client library that you want to send data from. Server-side data has limitations due to Google Analytics' API, so by default we leave this blank.\n\n## Advanced Options\n\n- *Cookie Domain Name*: If you set the domain name, then _only data sent from visitors on that domain_ will be recorded. [Read our docs here](/docs/integrations/google-analytics/#cookie-domain-name). By default Google Analytics will resolve the domain name automatically, so you should **leave this blank unless you know you want otherwise**! This option is useful if you need to ignore data from other domains, or explicitly set the domain of your Google Analytics cookie. This is known as Override Domain Name in [GA Classic](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/gaTrackingSite). If you are testing locally, you can set the domain to `none`.\n- *Enable Enhanced Ecommerce*: If you want more detailed reports on ecommerce, you might want to enable this feature. Read more about it [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce).\n- *Ignored Referrers*: Sometimes you want to Google Analytics to ignore certain referral domains, for example to prevent your subdomains from showing up as referrers in your analytics. Add any domains you want to ignore, separated by line breaks. _Note: this only works for Classic profiles. Universal profiles can [edit their ignored referrers](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795830?hl=en&ref_topic=2790009) directly inside Google Analytics._\n- *Track Named Pages*: This will track events to Google Analytics for [`page` method](https://segment.io/libraries/analytics.js#page) calls that have a `name` associated with them. For example `page('Signup')` would translate to **Viewed Signup Page**.\n- *Track Categorized Pages*: This will track events to Google Analytics for [`page` method](https://segment.io/libraries/analytics.js#page) calls that have a `category` associated with them. For example `page('Docs', 'Index')` would translate to **Viewed Docs Index Page**.\n- *Include the Querystring in Page Views*: The querystring doesn't usually affect the content of the page in a significant way (like sorting), so we disable this by default.\n- *Anonymize IP Addresses*: If you need to [anonymize IP addresses](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) sent to Google Analytics, enable this setting.\n- *Enable Enhanced Link Attribution*: If you want more detailed reports on the links clicked on your site, you might want to enable this feature. Read more about it [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2558867?hl=en).\n- *Add the non-interaction flag to all events*: Enable this setting to add a noninteraction: 1 flag to every event tracked to Google Analytics. If you're seeing unusually low bounce rates this will solve that issue.\n- *Site Speed Sample Rate*: If you have a small number of visitors, and want to get increased the sample size for your [site speed stats](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1205784?ref_topic=1282106&rd=1), then increase this number.\n- *Use Classic Analytics for Your Serverside Tracking*: **Important:** When creating your Google Analytics profile, you can choose between **Classic** and **Universal** Analytics. After March 2013, new profiles default to Universal, while earlier ones are Classic. An easy test: if you see `_gaq.push` in your code you're using Classic, so enable this.\n- *Send User-ID to GA*: User-ID enables the analysis of groups of sessions, across devices, using a unique and persistent ID. This only works with Google Analytics Universal. IMPORTANT: Sending email or other personally identifiable information (PII) violates Google Analytics Terms of Service.\n- *Send Uncaught Exceptions to GA (Mobile)*: This lets you study errors and exceptions in your iOS and Android apps in Google Analytics.\n- *Custom Dimensions*: Google Analytics only accepts numbered dimensions like `dimension3` and `dimension19`. When you `analytics.identify(userId, traits)` with custom traits, we need to map those traits to Google Analytics dimensions. Enter a trait name on the left, and the Google Analytics dimension you want on the right. Email [friends@segment.io](mailto:friends@segment.io) if you need help!\n- *Custom Metrics*: Google Analytics only accepts numbered metrics like `metric2` and `metric14`. When you `analytics.track(event, properties)` an event with custom `properties` or `analytics.identify(userId, traits)` with custom traits, we need to map those properties and traits to Google Analytics metrics. Enter a property or trait name on the left, and the Google Analytics metric you want on the right.
