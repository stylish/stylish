# Blueprint Release Planner App

This is a desktop application for creating and managing documents like Epics, Features, Milestones, Releases, Backlogs.  These are all documents used in software product development, and they describe the state and desired state of many different creative and strategic actions that take place in the field. These are actions which generate new discoveries and insights, actions which encounter obstacles and delays, and a number of other constraints.

It is because of this that the Agile software movement rejects dead documentation.  Through the use of Skypager's Active Document technology, we are able to increase the effectiveness and relevance of this writing and generate living versions of these documents.

## Vision

A Blueprint Release Plan is a perfect example of the Skypager Reactive Document in Action.  

Defining a Project and breaking it down into well defined deliverables and goals which can be estimated, prioritized, triaged, etc is a laborious task.

It traditionally takes place in different tools. All of this work can be done directly within this app within a single document interface that feels very much like Note taking.  Without the need to navigate another tool or app, all of these things can be written down at once during a planning meeting or during a flash of inspiration.

Later, through the use of the Skypager Model system, these documents can be turned into relational data objects and synced with external systems, where they exist as trackable, assignable tasks, with unique identities and a `status`.  As these entities change in these other systems, this gets get recorded in the project and updated on the project website automatically.

## Personas

### Software Architect

The Software Architect designs the software and collaboration structure for a software project.  They will generally be responsible for defining the major categories of development and design tasks.

### Contractors

When a project is sufficiently analyzed and documented, we can publish a request for proposals page, which allow developer and designer contractors to view details about the work we need done and the specifications for that work.  We can generate these as google documents or spreadsheets, or we can publish a markdown template and ask people to fill them in and submit them as an issue.

Contractors need these types of interfaces, guidelines for how to use them, and to be supplied with information and detail pages to be able to make informed estimates.
