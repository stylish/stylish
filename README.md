# Skypager Monorepo

This is a Monorepo for a collection of Skypager Projects,
aka a Portfolio.  It consists of documentation, projects,
and packages.  Packages refer to the reusable components and
boilerplate modules that are shared across the projects in
the portfolio.

## Dependency Management

This Monorepo automatically links to the `node_modules` of
the `skypager-presets` package.  This lets us manage a gold
standard set of dependencies for all projects and packages
in the repo.  

Each project version is synchronized and tied to the Git SHA
of the portfolio project.

## Documentation

Documentation for this Monorepo is generated from the
written markdown documents in the `docs` folder and takes
advantage of a lot of metadata and API queries that are
generated by inspecting the `package.json` metadata, `git
commit history` and other important elements that relate to
the release environment.

## Tests

The test suite for each package and project can be ran from
this central project repo.
